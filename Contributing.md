# Development

The Solution has two projects:

1. `blockchain` folder which contains the solidity contract for SHIB from mainet and also the development environment built using [`HardHat`](https://hardhat.orga/).
Currently we also deployed the SMART Contract into `Ropsten Network` at the address `0x1618ed63Edd5F8a21f86A8b8AD56508ec5614765`.
2. `frontend` folder contains the UI for SHIBurn
