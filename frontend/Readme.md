## Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Infura Key

Since the project uses [Infura](https://infura.io/) to access Etherum Blockchain please copy the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`. 
In there you can paste your Infura Key (you can start for free in Infura).

**Note**: If you are running the Frontend against HardHat then you dont need to provide a valid key in here.

## Run the interface

```bash
yarn start
```
